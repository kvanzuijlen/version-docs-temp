# Version

`version` is a CLI tool that can help you work with version numbers.
Currently, it only supports [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)
as a versioning scheme and Docker Registries (such as, but not limited to
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/),
[Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry), 
and [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)).
